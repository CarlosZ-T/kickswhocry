# kickswhocry
**Overview**
I'm creating a Discord bot named kicks who cry. This bot is going to be a sneaker monitor for upcoming releases as well as current discounts, availability, and much more! I'm currently planning to use Python to make this bot a reality. I've always been very into sneakers so I think creating this bot will be a very enjoyable experience. Alongside GitHub, I'm also using Jira for task management and Miro for user flow visualization. For now this will be just a short overview but stay tuned as this project comes together!
