# Kicks Who Cry

I'm creating a Discord bot named kicks who cry. This bot is going to be a sneaker monitor for upcoming releases as well as current discounts, availability, and much more! I'm currently planning to use Python to make this bot a reality. I've always been very into sneakers so I think creating this bot will be a very enjoyable passion project for me that I hope to make available for not just my use but anyone who'd love to get into sneakers. Alongside GitHub, I'm also using Jira for task management and Miro for user flow visualization. For now this will be just a short overview but stay tuned as this project comes together!
